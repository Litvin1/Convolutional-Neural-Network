# Convolutional-Neural-Network
Using CNN for classifing X-ray images to 4 categories: Negative for Pneumonia, Typical COVID-19 Appearance, Atypical COVID-19 Appearance, Indeterminate Appearance.
With the help of Google Colab, we used Convolutional Neural Network on kaggle data that is created by SIIM (Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine). The data set is in DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) format.
